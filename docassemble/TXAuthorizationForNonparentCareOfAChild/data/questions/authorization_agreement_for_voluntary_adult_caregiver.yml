    Authorization Agreement for Voluntary Adult Caregiver
  description: |-
    This interview helps a parent complete a Texas Authorization Agreement for
    Voluntary Adult Caregiver.
    
    Use this form to give someone temporary permission to make important decisions
    about your child's school and medical situation. You do not need to go to court
    to use this form, so it may be a good alternative to a guardianship or custody case.

    You may want to use this form if you are a parent who needs to leave your child with
    a relative or family friend for a while. For example: before you travel outside
    of the United States, either for a short or a long time.
    
    The caregiver must be at least 18 years
    old. They do not have to be related to the child.
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    You can use this form if you are one of the parents of a child. If there are two
    parents, in most cases you need to let the other parent know and give them a copy
    of this form.

    You must get court permission
    if there is an existing court order or a pending court case involving the child.
    
    This authorization does not allow the caregiver to consent to an abortion or
    emergency contraception. 
    
    If no parent can be found, a different court process
    may be required. Leaving a child with a nonparent for a long time can affect
    parental rights, so consider legal advice.
  before_you_start: |
    Before you start, gather:

    * The child's full name and date of birth.
    * Each parent's current address, phone number, and other contact information.
    * The caregiver's current address, phone number, and other contact information.
    * Information about any court order or pending case involving the child.
    * Any important child documents you may want to share (birth certificate,
      insurance card, school or medical records).

    You will need to sign the form in front of a notary. If only one parent signs,
    you must mail a copy of the signed form to the other parent within 10 days. You
    may not have to mail a copy in limited situations, such as when parental rights
    were terminated or certain safety exceptions apply.
  when_you_are_finished: |
    Sign the agreement in front of a notary. Give the caregiver a copy and keep a
    copy for your records. If only one parent signed, mail a copy to the other
    parent within 10 days by certified mail (return receipt requested) and by
    regular mail. If there is a court order or pending case, get written court
    permission and attach the court order to your agreement. You can revoke the
    agreement in writing at any time.
    You may also want to add the caregiver as an emergency contact with the
    child's school, doctor, and childcare provider.

  Authorization Agreement for Voluntary Adult Caregiver
subquestion: |
  This form lets a parent give a nonparent adult caregiver temporary permission
  to make some decisions for a child. You do **not** need to go to court to use
  this form.

  You may want to use this form if you are a parent who needs to leave your child with
  a relative or family friend for a while. The caregiver must be at least 18 years
  old. They do not have to be related to the child.

  The caregiver can do things like:

  * get medical care
  * enroll the child in school or daycare
  * and apply for benefits.
  
  The caregiver **cannot**:

  * consent to an abortion
  * consent to emergency contraception.
  
  This form does **not** give custody. It only gives temporary permission, for up to
  six months. You can end it any time in writing.

  Everyone who must sign will sign in front of a notary. If only one parent signs,
  you must mail a copy to the other parent within 10 days.

question: |
  Before you start
subquestion: |
  Use this form only if **a parent** is giving permission to **an adult caregiver**

  parent signs, you must mail a copy to the other parent.
